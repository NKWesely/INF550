# 2.9.1.1 Part 1: Sign up for and Use an NEON API Token:

```{r}
# call in your unique NEON API token
load('neon_token_source.Rdata')

# demonstrate the you can use your NEON API token to pull some data
veglist <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.10098.001", site="WREF", package="basic", check.size=FALSE, token = NEON_TOKEN)

# prep the data further
vegmap <- getLocTOS(veglist$vst_mappingandtagging, 
                    "vst_mappingandtagging")
veg <- merge(veglist$vst_apparentindividual, vegmap, 
             by=c("individualID","namedLocation",
                  "domainID","siteID","plotID"))
```



# 2.9.1.2 Part 2: Further Investigation of NEON TOS Vegetation Structure Data
## Question 1
Convert the previous diagram plot into a ggplot.

```{r}

veg %>% 
  filter(plotID == "WREF_075") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = adjEasting, y = adjNorthing, 
                 size = stemDiameter), shape = 1) +
  labs(x = "Easting", y = "Northing")
```

## Question 2
Set the color your circles to be a function of each species.

```{r}
veg %>% 
  filter(plotID == "WREF_075") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = adjEasting, y = adjNorthing, 
                 size = stemDiameter, color = scientificName), shape = 1) +
  labs(x = "Easting", y = "Northing")
```


## Question 3
Generate a histogram of tree heights for each plot. Color your stacked bar as a function of each species.

```{r}
veg %>% ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = measurementHeight, fill = scientificName)) +
  facet_wrap(~ plotID)
```

## Question 4
Use dplyr to remove dead trees.
```{r}
# what are all the options in plantStatus?
unique(veg$plantStatus)

vegLiv = veg %>%
  filter(
    plantStatus != "Dead, broken bole", 
    plantStatus != "Lost, fate unknown", 
    plantStatus != "Standing dead", 
    plantStatus != "No longer qualifies", 
    plantStatus != "Downed")

# make sure your filtering worked
unique(vegLiv$plantStatus)
```

## Question 5
Create a simple linear model that uses Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and height to predict allometries. Print the summary information of your model.

```{r}
model = lm(stemDistance ~ stemDiameter + measurementHeight,
            data = vegLiv)
summary(model)
```

## Question 6
Plot your linear model.
```{r}
plot.df = vegLiv %>%
  select(stemDiameter, measurementHeight, stemDistance, scientificName) %>%
  na.omit()

plot.df$predictions = predict(model)

plot.df %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = stemDiameter, y = predictions, color = scientificName)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = stemDiameter, y = predictions, color = scientificName))
```

## Question 7
Answer the following questions.

**What do you think about your simile linear model? What are its limitations?**

My simple linear model is pretty poor, which a vary low R2. Linear models have a lot of limitations, including the assumption of normally distributed residuals, the assumption of a linear relationship between your response and predictor(s), and the assumption of homoscedasticty. Also you just can't characterize complicated relationships with a simple linear model in general.

**How many unique species are present at WREF?**
```{r}
length(unique(veg$scientificName))
```

There are 25 unique species at the WREF site.

**What are the top_5 trees based on height? Diameter?**
```{r}
# What are the top 5 trees based on height?
vegHT = vegLiv %>% arrange(desc(measurementHeight)) %>%
  select(individualID, measurementHeight)

head(vegHT, n = 5)

# what are the top 5 trees based on diameter?
vegDM = vegLiv %>% arrange(desc(stemDiameter)) %>%
  select(individualID, stemDiameter)

head(vegDM, n = 5)
```


**What proportion of sampled trees are dead?**
```{r}
liveTrees = length(unique(vegLiv$individualID))
allTrees = length(unique(veg$individualID))
livePropor = liveTrees / allTrees
deadTreesProportion = 1 - livePropor

print("Proportion of sampled trees that are dead: ", deadTreesProportion)
```
